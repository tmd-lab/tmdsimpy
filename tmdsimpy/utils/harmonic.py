    Function to calculate the number of harmonic components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : (H,) numpy.ndarray
        Harmonics that should be included. E.g., numpy.array(range(5)).
        Must not include any repeated entries.

    only_C : bool, optional

    Generate an initial guess to an harmonic balance method (HBM) type problem 
    based on a linear system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vib_sys : tmdsimpy.VibrationSystem
        Vibration system for the initial prediction. The initial prediction is
        linear, so this should be linear around the state of interest (e.g., 
        for frictional systems create a new `tmdsimpy.VibrationSystem` around
        the prestressed state using the linearized stiffness).
        This must use mass and stiffness proportional damping.
        This system is defined to have `N` degrees of freedom.
    w : float
        frequency in rad/s that the prediction should occur at.
    Fl : 1D numpy.ndarray
        Forcing corresponding to the harmonics (each DOF of first component, 
        then each DOF of second component etc.).
        Only the first harmonic terms of Fl are considered.
        For equations that do amplitude and phase control, Fl should
        only include first harmonic cosine forcing terms to get correct 
        results.
        Size of `Fl` should be of size at least `(2+(h[0]==0))*N`.
    h : (H,) numpy.ndarray, sorted
        List of harmonics to include in solution. Should be sorted.
    solver : tmdsimpy.NonlinearSolver or similar
        Solver to be used in calculating an eigenproblem for `vib_sys`.
    equation : {'HBM', 'HBM_AMP', 'HBM_AMP_PHASE', 'VPRNM_AMP_PHASE'}
        Which equation to provide an initial guess for. Note that not all 
        options may be implemented yet.
        Options are
        
            'HBM' :
                standard HBM for frequency continuation,
            'HBM_AMP' : 
                Amplitude HBM with constant phase forcing ,
            'HBM_AMP_PHASE' :
                Amplitude HBM with constant response phase, variable 
                force phase (for frequency continuation),
            'VPRNM_AMP_PHASE' :
                VPRNM with amplitude and phase controlled HBM.
        
        If you need 'HBM_AMP_PHASE' for amplitude continuation, just change the 
        last entry of the returned array to be the desired prediction amplitude
        instead of frequency.
    Xstat : (N,) numpy.ndarray, optional
        Static displacement vector for the zeroth harmonic solution. 
        If None, zeros will be returned for the zeroth harmonic.
        Also only applies if harmonic 0 is included in `h`.
        The default is None.
    fmag : float, optional
        Scaling for the `Fl` vector. 
        This only matters if the mode is 'HBM'.
        Scaling does not apply to the zeroth harmonic.
        The default is None.
    control_amp : float, optional
        Amplitude of response is controlled to. 
        This does not matter for 'HBM'
        The default is None.
    control_recov : (N,) numpy.ndarray, optional
        Recovery vector which extracts the DOF of interest for amplitude 
        control. 
        The default is None.
    control_order : int, optional
        Power of frequency to multiply amplitude control by.
        Does not apply for 'HBM'.
        0 corresponds to displacment, 1 corresponds to velocity, 
        2 corresponds to acceleration.
        The default is None.
    rhi : int, optional
        Higher harmonic of interest to include in initial guess. 
        This only matters for `equation=VPRNM`.
        For VPRNM, this should be the harmonic that shows a superharmonic
        resonance.
        The default is None.
    neigs : int, optional
        The number of modes that should be used in constructing the linear
        prediction of the response amplitude.
        The default is 3.
    vib_sys_nl : tmdsimpy.VibrationSystem or None
        Vibration system with nonlinear forces (linear portions do not matter).
        Used exclusively for predicting nonlinear forces acting on
        superharmonic for 'VPRNM' prediction.
    vprnm_calc_grad : bool, optional 
        'calc_grad' flag to pass to VPRNM. This code does not need the gradient
        of VPRNM. However, not all nonlinear forces support the 
        `calc_grad=False`
        input argument. If the nonlinear forces do support this input argument
        it is recommended to use False because it will be faster.
        The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    Ulam0 : (N*Nhc+m,) numpy.ndarray
        Initial guess for the given set of equations. 
        This will include harmonic displacements as the first entries (N*Nhc).
        Harmonic components are for all DOFs of the first component, then all 
        DOFs of the next etc.
        The last `m` entries vary based on `equation` as follows
        
            'HBM' :
                forcing frequency (rad/s)
            'HBM_AMP' : 
                force scaling, frequency (rad/s)

    """
    Rotates a set of harmonic solutions through a phase defined at a given 
    harmonic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    U_orig : (M, Nhc*Ndof+a) or (Nhc*Ndof+a,) numpy.ndarray
        This is a set of harmonic solutions where rows are independent 
        solutions and each row contains `Nhc` sets of `Ndof` coordinates 
        corresponding to solution displacements. The rows contain all of the 
        first harmonic, then all of the second harmonic etc. as given by 
        the harmonics in h. Each harmonic greater than 0 has all cosine terms
        then all sine terms. 
        The last `a` columns of U_orig can be anything, are ignored and 
        returned as provided.
    Ndof : int
        Number of degrees of freedom defining the size of `U_orig` as above.
    h : numpy.ndarray, sorted
        Array of the harmonics used in `U_orig`.
    phase_rotate : float or (M,) numpy.ndarray
        Phase to rotate the solution `U_orig` through. See Notes for 
        description of sign. 
        This rotation is applied to the harmonic `h_rotate` which other 
        harmonics shifted by a consistent amount of time. 
        If this is an array, then each row of `U_orig` is shifted by a 
        different phase as given by the equivalent entry in this array.
    h_rotate : int
        The harmonic that should be rotated by `phase_angle`.

    Returns
    -------
    U_rot : (M, Nhc*Ndof+a) or (1, Nhc*Ndof+a) numpy.ndarray
        `U_orig` with the applied phase rotation. 
        The last `a` columns are directly copied from U_orig.

    Notes
    -----
    
    The number of harmonic components is 
    `Nhc = tmdsimpy.utils.harmonic.Nhc(h)`
    
    The phase angle is subtracted so if the input is
    `Uc * cos(Omega * t)`
    the output is `Uc*cos(Omega * t - phase_angle)` for `h_rotate==1`.
    
    The harmonic `h_rotate` is rotated by the phase angle and ther harmonics 
    are consistently rotated based on some time shift `t0` so that 
    `Uc*cos(h_rotate*Omega*(t-t0)) = Uc*cos(h_rotate*Omega - phase_angle)`.
